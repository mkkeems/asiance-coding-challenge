## A rails back REST API app that uses simple html/scss/vanilla javascript for the front.

Check out the deployed version through the link above or download the repo onto your local machine and run "rails s" on your cli to see the app running.
Used Faker gem for seed data. Seeded some good old "Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy" movie quotes and other lovely things.

The main goal of this app was to create a REST API and then to display data fetched from the API end points in javascript.
The two API end points that were created were Authors and Posts, where authors had many posts while each post was specific to an author.

Go to : https://asiance-challenge-mk.herokuapp.com/api/v1/authors & https://asiance-challenge-mk.herokuapp.com/api/v1/posts to see the API endpoints.
Crud function for both API endpoints can be checked out via Postman or other tools.
