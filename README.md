## A rails back REST API app that uses simple html/scss/vanilla javascript for the front.

Download the repo onto your local machine. Run "rails s" on your cli or check out the deployed version through the link above.
Used Faker gem for seed data. Seeded some good old "Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy" movie quotes and other lovely things.

The main goal of this app was to display data fetched from REST API end points in a single page blog format. The two API end points that were created were Authors and Posts.

Go to : https://asiance-challenge-mk.herokuapp.com/api/v1/authors & https://asiance-challenge-mk.herokuapp.com/api/v1/posts to see the API endpoints.
Crud function for both API endpoints can be checked out out via Postman.
